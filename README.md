# 🎇 Kinetic-Chaos

**A colorful, physics-driven animation where one ball bursts into many, bouncing, colliding, losing momentum, and settling under gravity. Built in Python with `matplotlib` + `numpy`.** Perfect for showcasing motion physics, collision detection, and animation skills.

## ✨ Features

* 💥 **Single-to-Multi Explosion**: Starts with one ball that bursts into multiple.
* 🎨 **Randomized Colors**: Every run looks unique and visually engaging.
* ⚡ **Real Physics**: Gravity, momentum loss, and elastic collisions implemented.
* 🖼 **Custom Background & Title**: Eye-catching display for project showcases.
* 🏁 **Automatic End**: Simulation stops when all balls settle on the floor.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Requirements**

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

**Run the Simulation**

```bash
python exploding_balls.py
```

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Matplotlib**: Animation and rendering
* **NumPy**: Physics calculations

---

## 📚 How It Works

* Balls are represented as physics objects with **position, velocity, and color**.
* On explosion, each ball gets a **random velocity vector**.
* **Gravity** continuously accelerates balls downward.
* **Collision detection** handles bouncing off walls and other balls.
* **Energy loss** simulates realistic slowing until rest.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add **sound effects** synced with collisions
* Export simulation as an **MP4 video**
* Interactive mode with **mouse-click explosions**
